# Accidental Queues on Spotify Mobile

I use Spotify’s mobile app every day to find new songs and listen to albums. Usually this involves me navigating back and forth between albums and artists. Spotify, like most mobile apps, allows users to swipe right to go back to the previous screen. This interaction feels natural and consistent across many mobile platforms.

However, Spotify gives the right swipe motion another characteristic as well. My goal is to go back to the previous page when I swipe right. Depending on if you swipe right directly from the corner of your screen or a few cm before then, dictates what a right swipe will do. If the right swipe is done on top of a song, it becomes queued. Typically, I open an album, scroll through a bit, and then swipe right to go back, but sometimes if I do that motion a little closer to the songs, it gets queued. Spotify interprets the swipe as an intentional "add to queue" gesture.

When this happens, Spotify does show a small message that says "Added to queue," so the feedback is clear. The issue isn't that Spotify fails to communicate, but that the action feels too easy to do by accident. The right swipe for adding a song to the queue is the same as the "go back" swipe, so I sometimes queue up a song when I only meant to navigate. Even though Spotify tells me what happened, it still messes up my song structure. It's a small annoyance, not a major usability problem, but one that stands out to me because of how often I swipe to move between screens.

This experience can tie to my mental model, as it is an expectation of what I think is supposed to happen based on habits from other apps. Swiping right usually means "go back," so it's surprising a similar gesture can trigger a different action. It's a good reminder that small inconsistencies can interrupt a smooth experience.
